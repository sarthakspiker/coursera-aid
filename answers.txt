I’m a student from India and want to Python. I took the first course from Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)
and I think it will be beneficial for my thesis work. So i want to complete the specialization. 
But I've no job of my own to carry the expanses to pay for the certificate of this course.
My dad is a small vendor and mom is housewife and hence can't support me financially. In this circumstance, it is very much difficult
for me to gather such amount of money for the certificate. Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on 
my monthly essential needs.  So I’m badly in need of this financial aid. This Specialization will boost my job prospects after graduation 
from my college. It will help me perform better in Python programming and other applications and give me an edge over my competitors.

I want to complete the Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python) specialization on Python offer by University of Michigan.
This Course will boost my job prospects after graduation from my college. It will help perform better in python programming 
and help me apply it in various aspects like machine learning and data analytics and give me an edge over my competitors.
An extra certification will add to my resume. As you may know Big Data and Machine Learning are mostly running on Python and
these topics are like hot cakes in the tech world, Taking this course will help me to better understand all the basics of python and 
its libraries. Also I plan to do masters in computer science, so exploring this course will open up many possibilities for selecting 
my course for masters and help me in my ultimate goal of being a reputed developer and community helper.
